If you have a help desk or call center software you can easily discover the most popular questions that customers have for your team. Some ticketing systems even offer tagging features that allow agents to label individual tickets which then automatically categorizes them in a stored database. That way, you can sort your tickets by topic, date, or popularity, when you're analyzing.
